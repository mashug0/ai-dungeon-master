Identify missing continuity elements\n3. Suggest minor adjustments to maintain consistency\n\n**ISSUES:**\n\n- The current action is described as Aragorn searching the goblin's body for treasure, but the context suggests Eira is the half-elf rogue performing the action.\n- The party context mentions Eira, Morgran, and Lyra, but Aragorn is not mentioned as a party member.\n- The recent conversation and current action are described from Eira's perspective, but the initial action was Aragorn's.\n\n**ADJUSTMENTS:**\n\nTo maintain consistency, the current action should be adjusted to reflect Eira's perspective. The party context should be revised to include Aragorn as a party member.\n\n🔧 AGENT WORKINGS:\n   Memories extracted: 8\n     - Here are the extracted key facts for long-term memory:\n     - The party consists of Eira (half-elf rogue), Morgran (dwarf cleric), and Lyra (human wizard), traveling through the mystical forest of Elvendom to find the Starlight Crystal.\n     - The party encountered hostile centaurs in a hidden glade, where they discovered a cryptic poem etched into an ancient tree.\n     - Lyra sensed a faint magical aura emanating from a nearby thicket, which might be a sign of the Starlight Crystal's proximity.\n     - Aragorn (not explicitly stated, but presumably the player controlling Aragorn) attacked a goblin with his sword.\n     - The party discovered a hidden glade with an ancient tree bearing a cryptic poem.\n     - The poem hints at the location of the Starlight Crystal, mentioning the whispering woods and ancient secrets.\n     - The party found a glowing stone, but its location was not specified.\n   Consistency notes: ['Response appears consistent']\n\n📊 FINAL MEMORY STATE:\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"e9fdde04dd0d44ff9b51e708862e5863"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":163}]}
